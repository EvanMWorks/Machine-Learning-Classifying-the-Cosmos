# Machine-Learning-Classifying-the-Cosmos
Using KNN models, decision trees, confusion matrices, and simple and multiple logistic regression models, we found the most accurate model for classifying between galaxies, quasars, and stars. The data was pulled from the European Space Agency (ESA) mission Gaia using SQL and then all of the work was done in Rstudio
